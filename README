LaTeX/Beamer templates
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The most important part is in "texmf": Beamer templates. These
templates can be put at local ~/texmf to be shared across different
talks. It is put here locally for convenience.

Makefile is not needed too, you can just invoke pdflatex if everything
is in PATH. Again, this project has it for convenience.
